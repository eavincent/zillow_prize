## Overview of Competition
The [Zillow prize competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1): In this million-dollar competition, participants will develop an algorithm that makes predictions about the future sale prices of homes. The contest is structured into two rounds, the qualifying round which opens May 24, 2017 and the private round for the 100 top qualifying teams that opens on Feb 1st, 2018. In the qualifying round, you’ll be building a model to improve the Zestimate residual error. In the final round, you’ll build a home valuation algorithm from the ground up, using external data sources to help engineer new features that give your model an edge over the competition.

In this competition, Zillow is asking you to predict the log-error between their Zestimate and the actual sale price, given all the features of a home. The log error is defined as

*logerror=log(Zestimate)-log(SalePrice)*

and it is recorded in the transactions file *train.csv*. In this competition, you are going to predict the logerror for the months in Fall 2017. Since all the real estate transactions in the U.S. are publicly available, we will close the competition (no longer accepting submissions) before the evaluation period begins.

## Project Plan

### 1. Learn Machine Learning (ML)
* Complete Skill track for ML in [R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning) (16hrs) **in progress**
* Go through [Titanic tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) on Kaggle

### 2. Import and Explore Data
Become familiar with the format and general structure of the data.

* ~~Check if missingness correlates with logerror~~ **done**
* ~~Check if missingness of variables correlates with each other~~ **done**
* ~~Check if logerror correlates with any of the variables~~ **done**

### 3. Clean Data
Determine how to handle missing data and confirm that the classification methods are consistent for all entries (e.g. are bathrooms included in the total number of rooms?)

* ~~Create a column for "imputed" in case of non-random missingness~~ **done**
* Impute variables from information in other variables 
    + ~~Impute fireplaceflag by fireplacecnt~~ **done**
    + ~~Impute missing data as negative response for taxdelinquency flag~~ **done**
    + ~~Impute taxdelinquency year based on tax delinquency flag and vice versa~~ **done**
    + ~~Impute pool info between the pool variables~~ **done**
    + ~~Impute zip by city and vice versa for cities and zips that are uniquely associated~~ **done**
    + ~~Finish imputing zip and city via latitude/longitude coordinates~~ **done**
* Remove features that have too much missing data

### 4. Develop and Evaluate Algorithms
* ~~Predict the mean as a baseline~~ **done**
* ~~Linear model as secondary baseline~~ **done**
* Random forest

## To-do for Report:
* Upload code to Kaggle and make public so that code is reproducible for instructors
* ~~Try ggmap to map properties~~ **done**

#### Tables and figures:
* ~~Plot missingness~~ **done**
* Make a table for MAE (and R^2?) values to compare models
